# Solving Ordinary Differential Equations Numerically

## Introduction

As seen in the previous chapter, our main focus in this course is to solve ODEs i.e., 1 independent variable per dependent variable numerically.

**Initial Value Problem(IVP):** ODE along with boundary conditions at a single point. Typically, independent variable is time. 

Example:- 
\begin{equation}
    \frac{d^2\theta}{dt^2}+C\frac{d\theta}{dt}+\frac{g}{l}\sin \theta = 0
\end{equation}
with "initial conditions" given by $\theta(t=0)= \theta_0$ and $\frac{d\theta}{dt}(t=0) = 0$. 

**Boundary Value Problem(BVP):** Conditions known at multiple points
Example:- 
\begin{equation}
    \frac{d^2\theta}{dt^2}+C\frac{d\theta}{dt}+\frac{g}{l}\sin \theta = 0
\end{equation}
with "initial conditions" given by $\theta(t=0)= \theta_0$ and $\theta(t=1) = 0$.

Note that the above ODE is 2nd order, non-linear and homogeneous ODE. If an external forcing is given, then the equation becomes non-homogeneous.

We can convert the above second order ODE to a set of 2 first order ODEs.

Define $$\omega = \frac{d\theta}{dt}$$

Therefore equation() can be written as:
$$\frac{d\omega}{dt}+C \omega+\frac{g}{l}\sin \theta = 0$$
Therefore, equation() can be written as a system of 1st order ODEs as:
\begin{equation}
\begin{bmatrix} \dot{\theta} \\  \dot{\omega} \end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix} \omega \\  -C \omega-\frac{g}{l}\sin \theta \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}

with initial conditions as 
\begin{equation}
\begin{bmatrix} \theta(0) \\  \omega(0) \end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix} \theta_0 \\  0 \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}

Similarly, we can express any $n$th order ODE as system of $n$ 1st order ODEs. 

Hence, we'll look into solving a first order ODE numerically and then solve Simple Pendulum equation numerically.
