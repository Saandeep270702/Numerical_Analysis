# Quadratures
In this chapter, we see how to find a definite integral numerically.
## Motivation
Consider a continuous function $f(x)$ in an interval $[a,b]$. We are interested in finding the integral $\int_a^b f(x)\, dx$. 

If we don't know $f(x)$ at all points, then how to find integral? Based on what we have studied till now, one way we can think of to approximate the integral is to first find a polynomial interpolant $p(x)$ using the known points and then find the integral $\int_a^b p(x) \, dx$. We can say that 
\begin{equation}
\int_a^b f(x)\, dx \approx \int_a^b p(x) \, dx
\end{equation}

But we have seen that there are issues like non-uniform convergence based in node distribution in the previous chapter. Therefore, we avoid this method. We resort to other methods to find the definite integral numerically.

Now, even if we know the exact form of the function at all points in the interval $(a,b)$, we can not always find a closed form for the anti-derivative of the function. 

Example:- Consider $f(x) = \exp(-x^2)$. We can't find the exact form of $\int f(x)\, dx = \int e^{-x^2}\, dx$. We can find $\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-x^2}\, dx$ using multivariable calculus methods say exactly. But for some random finite interval $(a,b)$, it is impossible to find the exact value. To get the approximate value, we use numerical methods. 

In some cases, though finding exact value of the integral is possible, it is extremely difficult to find it. 


## Different Schemes

### Basic Schemes

**ATTACH FIGURES FOR EACH SCHEME**

1. Lower/Left Riemann Sum:

\begin{equation}
\int_a^b f(x) \, dx \approx \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} f(x_i) \left( \frac{b-a}{n} \right)
\end{equation}

2. Upper/Right Riemann Sum:

\begin{equation}
\int_a^b f(x) \, dx \approx \sum_{i=1}^{n} f(x_i) \left( \frac{b-a}{n} \right)
\end{equation}

3. Trapezoidal Rule:
Instead of rectangles, let us approximate the areas by first dividing into trapeziums and summing up areas. 

\begin{equation}
\int_a^b f(x) \, dx \approx \frac{1}{2} h \left[ \sum_{i=1}^n (f(x_{i-1})+f(x_i)) \right]
\end{equation}

We can see that the trapezoidal rule is an average of Left and Right Riemann Sums.

4. Midpoint/Rectangular rule

\begin{equation}
\int_a^b f(x) \, dx \approx h \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} f\left( \frac{x_i+x_{i+1}}{2} \right) 
\end{equation}
